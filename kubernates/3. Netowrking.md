## Networking, services, nodeport & volumes
### Networking in kubernates

**Kubernates networking addresses this concerns**
1. containers within a pod use netoworking to communicate via loopback
2. cluster networking provides communication between different pods.
3. The service resources lets you expose an application running in pods to be reachable from outside your cluster
4. you can also use services to publish services only for consumption inside your cluster

**Container to container communication on same pod happens through localhost within the container**

**Pod to pod communication between two different pods within same machine node**
- pod to pod communication on same worker node happens through pod ip
- by default pod's ip will not be accessible outside the node.

 ### Services 
each pod pod gets own ip address however in deployment, the set of pods running in a  momment in time could be different from the set of pods running that applcation a moment later
This leads to a problem: if some set of pods previous functionality to other pods inside your cluster, how do the frontend find out and keep track of which ip to communicate so, that frontend can use backend part of the workload ?
so where services came in picture 

when services needed:
- when using rc, pods are terminted and creatied during scale up and scale down or replication operatipons
- when using deployment, while updating the image version the pods are terminated and new pods take the place of other pods
- pods are very dynamic i.e.  they come & go on the k8s cluster and on any available nodes  & it would be difficult to access the pods as the pods ip changes as it recreated.


service object is an logical bridge between pods and end users, which provides virtual ip \
it allows clients to connect to the containers running in the pod using the vip \
the vip is not an actual ip connected to a network interface, but it's purpose is purely to forward traffic to one or more pods \ 
kube proxy is the one which keeps the mappign between the vip and the pods upto date, which queries the api server to learn about new services in the cluster \
althrough eachpods has a unique ip address, those ips are are not exposed outside the cluster 
**services helps to expose the vip  mapped to the pods & allowes application to receive traffic** \
Labels are used to select which are the pods to be put under service \
creating a service will create an endpoint to access ths pods/application in it.\
it can be exposed in different ways 
1. cluster ip
   - exposes vip only reachable from within the cluster
   - mainly used to communicate between dirrefent components of microservices 
3. nodeport
   - make a service accessible from outside cluster
   - exposes the service on the same port of each selected node in the cluster using NAT. 
5. loadbalancer
6. headless

 ### Volumes
 - containers are shortlived in nature
 - all data stored inside container is deleted id container crashes, then kubelet start new container with a clean state
 - to overcome this problem kubernates uses volumes.
 - in kubernates, a volume is attached to a pod and shared among the containous of that pod
 - the volume has same life span as a pod

**Volume Types**
- a volume type decides the properties of present directory eg:
- node-local type such as a empty dir and hostpath
- file sharing path such as nfs
- cloud provider specific types like awselacticstore, azuredisk
- disctributed file system types, for example glusterfs or cephfs
- special purpose type such as sectrate, git repo

1. Empty dir
   - use this when we want to share contents between multiple containers on the same pod & not to the host machine
   - an emptydir volume is first created when a pod is assigned to a node, and exist as long as pod is running on that node
   
Sample
```
......
    volumeMounts:
      - name: xchange
        mountPath: "/tmp/data"
......
  volumes:
  - name: xchange
    emptyDir: {}
......
```
2. Host path
   - use this when we want to access content of a pod/container from hostmachine
   - a hostpath volume mounts a file or directory from the host node's filesystem into your pod
  
Sample
```
.....
    volumeMounts:
    - mountPath: /tmp/hostpath
      name: testvolume
  volumes:
  - name: testvolume
    hostPath:
      path: /tmp/data
.....
```

### Persistent Volume
 - in order to use a pv you need to claim it first, using a persistant volume claim(pvc)
 - the pvc request a pv with your desired specification from kubernates and once a suitable volume is found, it is bound to a pvc
 - after a successfull bounf to a pod, you can mount it as a volume.
 - we can use persistant disk(gcp) ebs(amazon) for us persistant volume in kubernates
 - 

### Health check
- a pod is considered ready when all of its containers are ready
- in order to verify if a container in a pod is healthy and ready to serve traffic, kubernates provides for a range of healthy checking mechanism
- health checks or probes are carried out by the kubelet to determine when to recrete a container(for liveness) and used by services and deployments to determine it should receive traffic
- one use of readiness prob is to control which pods are used as backends for services. when a pod is not ready, it is removed from services load balancers
- for running health checks, we would use commands specific to application
- if the command success ot return 0 and the kubelet considers the container to be alive and healthy.
- if command returns a non zero value, kubelet kills the pod and recreate it.

Sample
```
.....
    livenessProbe:                                          
      exec:
        command:                                         
       - cat                
       - /tmp/healthy
      initialDelaySeconds: 5          
      periodSeconds: 5                                 
      timeoutSeconds: 30
.....
```
