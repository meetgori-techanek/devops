## networking, services, nodeport & volumes
### Networking in kubernates

**kubernates networking addresses this concerns**
1. containers within a pod use netoworking to communicate via loopback
2. cluster networking provides communication between different pods.
3. The service resources lets you expose an application running in pods to be reachable from outside your cluster
4. you can also use services to publish services only for consumption inside your cluster

container to container communication on same pod happens through localhost within the container
