## what is helm 
- it helps you to manage k8s applications with `helm charts` which helps you define, install, and upgrade upgrade even the most complex kubernates application.
- helm is ths k8s equivalent of yum or apt
- the main building block of helm is based deployments are helm charts these charts desribe a configure set of dynamically generated k8s resources.
- the charts can either be stored locally or fetched from remote chart repositories 

## Why Use Helm
- writing and monitoring kubearnated yaml manifest for all the required kubernated objects can be time consuming and tedious task for the simplest of deployments, you would need atleast 3 yaml manifest with duplicated and hardcoded values.
- helm simplifies this process and create a single package that can be advertised  to your cluster
- helm k8s automatically maintains a database of all versions of your relases. so weather something goes wrong during deployment, rolling back to previous version is just one command away

**Keyword to understand Helm**
**Chart:** Helm chart are simply yml manifests combined into a single package that can be advertise to your k8s cluster
**Release:** A Release is aN instance of a chart running in a k8s cluster, one chart can often  be installed many times into the same cluster and each time it is installed, a new release created
**Repository** Location whare packaged charts can be  stored or shared
