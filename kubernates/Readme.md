# Kubernates

## History
- Kubernetes is an open-source container orchestration tool. 
- Originally developed by Google in 2014 for internal container management, where it was initially called Borg (not Coorg). 
- Written in Go (Golang).
- Now maintained by the Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF).

## Why Use
- Kubernetes is widely used in modern DevOps practices because it simplifies the deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications. Key reasons to use Kubernetes include:
- Automation: Automates deployment, scaling, and operations of application containers.
- Scalability: Easily scale applications up or down based on demand, either manually or automatically.
- High Availability: Ensures application uptime through self-healing and fault tolerance.
- Portability: Works across different cloud providers (AWS, GCP, Azure) and on-premises environments.
- Consistency: Provides a consistent development, testing, and production environment.
- DevOps Friendly: Integrates well with CI/CD pipelines, promoting agile and DevOps workflows.
- Resource Optimization: Efficiently uses infrastructure resources via scheduling and resource allocation.
  
## Pros and Cons
- **Pros:**
- Orchestration: Manages clusters of nodes and containers, even across multiple clouds.
- Autoscaling: Supports both horizontal (add more pods) and vertical (increase pod resources) scaling.
- Load Balancing: Distributes traffic across services to maintain performance.
- Platform Independent: Runs on any infrastructure (cloud or on-prem).
- Fault Tolerance: Automatically restarts failed pods, replaces them, and handles node failures.
- Rollback: Revert to previous versions of applications if something goes wrong.
- Health Monitoring: Actively checks the health of applications and replaces unhealthy containers.
- Batch Execution: Handles batch jobs that can be run once, sequentially, or in parallel.
- **Cons:**
- Complexity: Steep learning curve for beginners.
- Resource Intensive: Requires significant system resources and configuration.
- Overhead: Not ideal for small-scale applications or simple deployments.
- Security: Needs careful setup and management to avoid security vulnerabilities.
